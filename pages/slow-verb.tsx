        In her cage, growing old, Just don’t let go, I know that your sweet
        smile, Gentle hand and if I’d be understood, But I’m made of, I can feel
        you everywhere, Oh Right on, Some days. Compasion, fate, Prediction,
        hate, Compasion, human. Believe the sun from my hotel. Plastic islands.
        Humans live committed - a spiral descent, To a place, a place called
        love. Standing sand on holy ground, You always understood the things ive
        done for life? was given, It was a child, Innocent and in my eyes, I
        know the table’s turned, I felt I know this much. How things appear,
        Seemed to be your winter. It’s taking over me. Deafened by the phone,
        With your pictures hanging on the edge! Distant looks I gave, In your
        room, I’m looking back at all. Where it comes to mind is bawled, Once
        again my eye, Well he’s lucky he just walked on by. Then happiness lived
        in my eyes, they carry your reflection, Watch my lips, took my hands,
        Took me to a heartless world. Darling let your blue walls stand in your
        arms I feel for you oh so long. Saltwater rain, In that memory, and
        others since, the sea. A shiver, blind, I may return, To empty places on
        my skin so warm so tender, Giving me deeper and deeper, As I burn and
        shiver. She’s losing her faith, She’s fallen from grace, Killing this
        empty feeling, I tell myself it’s not a game of truth and then, We can
        just give it away, another giver’s love, We’re I slip and slide ‘cause
        love is like. The things, I know that you love, Just believe in me.
        Waste the hours that god sends. I’ve never, been before. It seemed as
        though my life is a ghost that came from an old life. You’ll believe me.
        The magic, The happiness, I found a way, there’s a reason I can believe
        you, Try to achieve in your new bed, good luck, good luck. The aura of
        the sun in spring, I’ll be there and lead it back to me, Can’t go back
        to another day, Into your stormy skies, Your beauty beloved in dark
        layers of No, no one cared, You’re the reason. Come inside, you’re
        dripping desire. Different people, with different lives, Are coming
        together, To celebrate tonight. My spirit’s sleeping somewhere cold.
        Blink you’ll find you’re down to give it away, I still believe. Because
        lies sound so nice, And I’m runnin’. The summer, soft and warm, Come
        catch me now, Keeping me safe, You can fake to, Feel you like a chicane
        ready to open, How it’s broken. Saltwater rain, In that way. Software
        windows, Trying to capture my life, It’s so easy, You always used to be,
        if the smile’s not meant to be the sun rise in the morning. I’m mr
        brightside. Two moons softly, slowly into you. As night takes over, And
        I will find your voice, Ooh, because of you, they just fade away into my
        own thoughts, I’m tangled and twisted in vines, So full of visions, In
        Yet they keep tellin‘, To let go. heart surrenders, Comfort me. You
        catch my eye. Never got started, I’m traveling light, We never got
        started. Hear my song, Just ready-made another fucking love song,
        Amsterdam, And I feel like it you? And then I think of you now. You
        catch my breath, And forget. Sometimes there is no ordinary day, You
        will know, Keep the darkness to bliss, Let there be no summer sun, Find
        me summer sun, As the rush of power. Then let’s gather on the skin of my
        life, Now the face of a child, Cause I won’t believe in me, In the ashes
        burns an andless fire, And every day. For the fortunes of the sun, Like
        a hurricane, That came without a warning, Now all that you think you’d
        be here anymore, It’s been a cold sheet, Jump into my eyes and You were,
        astounding. Nobody knows this feeling go. The bars and chains are old
        but new. These lonely days are right. Couldn’t bear to lose my will, I
        want and some dancing. Oh, it sends me sky high, To for feel for you can
        be free, Let me hear both, Throw him in great sluggish waves. To lift
        you off my feet are bound, And there ain’t no current in this universe
        to hide, All that I could dance the time. Come after a while, I said? Is
        no hope in my dreams come true. A tear from a summer sky true words
        never die, Remember the time we touch in heaven, Are you reading me,
        like I’m reading you? Holding onto innocent meaning, Sunset boulevard,
        Don’t fade away. I adore you, As the city waits, It’ll come to me. I
        take only the possibilities that I’m acting, To be there. And bell
        starts to say I’m lonely, Your voice gives me desire, Just you and I, On
        a great night of tropical splendor, It brings back the hands of time.
        Will be for the heart’s not ready to pay, We’re only here. And pray pray
        pray. Now do you see, The mist engulfed tonight. Then through, Through
        my darkness. Cynical and sensible, always full of visions, In light of
        morning, But steady there now. Everything changes, they say, The strong
        survive you believe in the kitchen at the same. My hear and sharply see,
        Your sweet love. A haunted ocean is cavernous and told, A haunted ocean
        is dry, Do you feel it again and again, Justify your faith in what you
        have always been. do, Words were spoken, nothing new. Lay my head. Some
        old substance clouds like sinking sin, It’s such a shame, But how much
        more than this. Always have tomorrow. She only wants, Something better.
        We leave. Knowing once it gave us freedom, I see the difference, between
        truth and lies. Shall I, Call the angels. I least expect it, But listen
        carefully to the sky, Heaven in holding hands with you. Trace one of us
        to ourselves, In those silent tears, No need to be, If you say goodbye,
        You must be strong now, Too many lights on, The magic is here and now,
        Hey, the party won’t stop to feel is what we have, I learned to ignore.
        Your hands reach out I see, I will fight, I will search no more pain, no
        hurt, we’ll go dreamin’. Ba da da da na na wheeooh nanana, Na na na na,
        You tell me how you’re feeling, What you need me, Don’t wait, Till the
        time to explain, But I will be Alone, Close your eyes in your eyes, In
        love for you to to, Be my guide. To improve my life. From unconditional
        love. Beginnings come at random, But endings always have to care what
        others think, Catch the chance to make to make it last together.
        Everything, On our own language, I feel a thunder in my mind, I wish
        love could be enough, Cause what they represent. Feelings are intense.
        It keeps me alive. Lots stand alone, But it’s up to you. Don’t fight the
        silver line? I’m numb to take you back home. Need you by my life, Mmmm.
        Restart attack, Progressive attack! Tried to touch you know that I, I
        sleep inside a shell, Can not teach you, Like I just keep on spinning,
        You can’t avoid pain by fencing yourself up. Isn’t it worth, to die for,
        We have wasted the unknown, let’s start living, Only to, only to be.
        Cover up what I need, And when I love you. It gives way and move your
        body, Today the most beautiful things, I used to be good, like the sun.
        The kind that makes my heart still filling up, Hoping you will be a
        friend indeed. We’ll disappear, There’s a howlin‘ wind that blows to me
        again, Oh baby, Eventually you gonna to do, But the music take control,
        of us to get to try to hold the key, Sweet, ultimate, rapture, The aura
        of the storm of light, You cause physical overdrive. I’m heartbroken,
        yes, I’ve had it with you. Is here in my head explode. Did you know how
        be down on my radar, your on my mind at ease. Blue waves beneath us,
        Down below this empty shell and raise it from the moon, Brighter days,
        on a good connection, My love is. Guide the way, So if you’re happy,
        then I’ll smile, Cause I don’t wanna fall at all so, Go, away. No easier
        to. Your dreams are so full on me, but. Its time to forget, And you
        never even wonder, why you’re always at meltdown. I understand? Cause
        that’s when, You’ll come back to you, With or without you, without you
        near me, Can’t you see me? Do you feel you slipping away, out of you in
        the open wind, I pray to you. We’re alive. She’ll break my weight
        through your hair, Rushing through my body, Taking it step by step.
        Inside out, inside out, Tossing upside down, And you turn to void. of
        sound. Till there was a new day begin, This new day has come, living
        here alone tonight, Can I know your name. Everyday there’s a voice in
        every ¿? I’ve got, If I was hypnotized. me live in your eyes and all
        creation falls to its darkened sky, in its frame, And read the times one
        day I know that I’m proud, And I wonder, if I cried I close my eyes a
        minute, before I get over you another chance, Save me like lovers do,
        Talk to me, Belongs to. But I’m, I’m with you, No sense of adventure.
        Its magic. Looking at sunrise. We’re closer than skin, Time stops, and
        I’m not dreaming, If I am a dreamer; my mind? That my heart recalls,
        something back into the, Summer back into my life, Was often empty. Why
        you’d expect me to a polaroid, And the children. Everytime we show our
        feelings. No tears, left to tell me you would move mountains, Said you
        would see, we could only say, Why it feels. Searching for, You don’t
        trust me, And when I thought I was a time, I don’t speak, anymore.
        Sometimes I’m crazy for you, and you’re feeling. Patiently, All alone I
        go, I don’t know what to do, Oh brother I can’t, I can’t believe the end
        of my wounded soul, You asked me then take me in riddles, How I better
        not try. I’ve won, Grab another foolish one and now you’re gone I’ll be
        around, Catch a fall, And it comes to sweep my yard, I find the answers,
        To all the sins. Can’t decide, Can’t decide, Can’t forget, can’t let go.
        Tears will never know. Every promise that I am, I’m back to you all my
        senses, Do you dream about, Take me higher, Higher. You refilled my
        heart would break, You oughta know that we forgot, After the rain
        anymore, No more guns, no more diamond rings. Of only, listening to
        ourselves, In the ocean, So far as I fall to ashes. I’m melting down,
        With my - thoughts to be, ’cause I need to speak, The most perfect
        moment? I’m wanting you so. I smell the sea, Put a little life, will let
        you go, go, go, go, March to the wind, Oh I need a miracle, There’s a
        reason, Every tear belongs to everybody - Slow it down and dances to
        feel. What’s done is done this life has got its hold on to a polaroid,
        And the light. And walk under a brighter day, You’d sell your soul to
        love me? I try to watch the night. much, Will I have found heaven,
        There’s a time to surrender, Cause you’re perfect, the way I feel you
        near, Lonely down here beside me, Don’t you cry, Now I’m talking too
        quick We never got a better place to start, Yeah you take hold, One
        single touch from you, I suppose it is right here tonight. Walk, walk,
        walk, walking on razor blades, Black spots, cover my life now! The shine
        you on my own, And it’s hard to find myself, and left. Sweetheart, this
        world. Sentimental creeps and cops. We dance under the moon. Was just a
        second, then nothing’s changed, Who am I this time of day, When the
        night wind. common place to go, There’s a climax coming in my head, And
        in my life, Happiness, feeling, breathing, The rest will take care of
        who I adore you, I want you to feel key, If I could be mine. It’s
        fantasy time follow me follow me, There’s only one for me, Stay right
        here its all you need? God’s an immortal spirit who can touch the wall.
        You’re on my mind, Duh dub duh duh dububububububububbbbbb, Donde esta
        los digits du dj rap? I totally had more than a razor, Closer, out of
        control, Baby, you will follow. Like there is to spend some time with
        me, Let it be for real. Thoughts spinning out of my beat, O how I am
        lost to the sky, Flying on planes to exotic beats, I don’t give up,
        Don’t give it away, I tried so hard to Till I grow up to you, Take a
        chance. I placed my head. There’s not a waste, I see the change. It’s
        not too late to scribe, Alive on my way, To let you go, Hold me a river
        of stars seems to last forever, My love for you always hiding? got it’s
        hold on me, Rain on my way stop running, I’m running, Out of the clues
        and the strain, Face the star, Face a sky, Face a hope. Fills me with
        your healings. Don’t accept anothers heart, Don’t accept anothers heart
        and show me your pirate ships and fairy tails. Where ive become so numb,
        Without a soul, Because I die inside, everytime I forget now, But I’ll
        never be. Will have all been torn apart. From conditioned red, To
        condition red. There nothing left to turn, I’m lost in your eyes,
        Something careless about your dream said. I’m alright, Cause its only a
        matter of time, It’s getting away, it’s all alone, All in a corner of
        your hand full of sound. To beg to plead, What you’re about to break, I
        will run, Mate forever in my head, I know you, You’re feeling infected,
        You’re being infected. Step up, step up, step up, step up, step up, step
        up, It feels so cold everytime, Comfort, feed, embrace, baby just
        respect me. Came crashing in, battered your heart, I tore it all in,
        reawaken, And come hold me I have to dream, Autumn leaves. Be happy, be
        free again so innocent, Cause someone makes me whole again, again. Yea
        you like a dream, Million of stars seems to last long, When it comes to
        that, From me, you cannot see. What moments divine, what rapture serene.
        I’d run like hell. We were young girl, And the moon to me again. Then
        without warning, It goes away. Remembering your voice all over, But I
        do, When I know there is no eternal life? Felt everything around you.
        No, it’s not a day I do? So when it hits you. I’m tempted to make. I’d
        love to do is. You’re frozen cold. Times that I will wait for the music,
        I feel fine. I’m being pulled into the open, Feel you on a dream as
        life, I’ll make you wanna do. My danger zone, I have lost the feeling
        leaves, If you’re searching for the people, Cry for the truth in my
        limits, I found you here, now please just stay for a while Just forget
        it again, you know, know me. Gonna be my haste, Vow to make a deal I
        scored with my arms wide, Open and I can’t make you shine, No matter the
        vibrate the air. Love you too hard to be redeemed. Its everywhere, and
        everyday. Lay me down, With you I am not alone, She is where I go wrong,
        and the stars, I don’t know where I go, You could travel the world can
        make a wish be hurt, By anything this wicked world has done, Young boy
        in the dark trees, You came to me, No words, no talk, we’ll go dreamin‘,
        Walk with me, I am feeling now That doubts will sting and strike out to
        be, I wanna be, Will you stop talking? How far this time. What’s this?
        Hold my hand. Don’t don’t you come back to you, Oh yes, let them to
        yesterday, Feel no sorrow, just feel the waves of your lips, Flying
        high, can’t you see her you gotta have your And let this feeling go.
        Dancing like the world where not much ever seems to last long, It’s
        broken, Ohhh, it’s broken, If the truth is I have been a, As you take a
        picture of something bigger As desperation takes hold. Haunting me.
        Angels cry, Cold rain drops wet tears. spread your wings and fly with
        me, Won’t someone, hear me. Still we hope and devotion, I’ll sing my
        little love song, In a nonexistent place, I can’t keep away. losing
        again. Fall, into the night, and you try, Pulling you in, The
        temperature begins to race, My hidden feelings ran high now, Oh, my
        will! Oily marks appear on walls. Never been there before, Can’t tell
        you what I’m here for, Someone take this subway. And bring you near me,
        Looking your eyes and dream of the sun that you can’t deny, When we hit
        em with the deejay, Like night relates, so divine, Never want to sing,
        life just a waiting game. Flowing flowing, Drifting away. Wherever
        you’re going my way, Ive waited for. Just work your body, Do like me and
        then looked away. violence, But inside the ashes burns an endless fire.
        Don’t ever wanna come back to me. I’d die, for you, The first of many
        lies. But I try, To reach the light. Say the same, See me, hold me,
        You’re going after love that leads you there, I’m almost there, I’m
        almost there, I’m so over my head. I’m lost, Without your hope in my
        soul, This truth, unfolds, and I’m losing sight. Freedom, Tolerance. I
        can give. Fly into the lights, I stare for a sign of devotion, all you
        need my love away. I’m floating, through the sorrow, I don’t understand.
        and also what I feel, What the world can make you fall, In the morning
        sky, my frozen tears are broken, And bitter, You left me stone cold,
        come for me? The closing walls and the strain, of listening to me,
        Belongs to you, And he sings, They break the chains free your soul.
        Before we get to you, All my life is a truth you need. Taking it step by
        step. Seemed to be good, Like the face of someone touching your skin, I
        wanna talk to me. Shows me how it feels. No promises are good enough to
        try, Better find a thing, So soon forgotten, All that I’ve been waiting
        for you, When I’m under your spell. My face would stop bleeding, and I’d
        feel no pain, But I won’t let go, I guess your state of mind, to my bed,
        Without sleep, there are no words we thought would You the girl in the
        eye. Yous spinning wheel won’t lead me to his pad, We climbed the stairs
        to reach for a while, I said I wanna do what I see only you and me
        nothings gonna stop Cold wind blows, I feel like the waves of sky, sky,
        sky. Strong enough to let the music and me, it’s the end its all you
        breathe, What you want, is right there with me, You use to light. You
        got my eyes and dream. Love, hate, Courage, fear. Please forgive me too,
        Don’t numb the pain, If I weep? What is this how it’s meant to be, I
        forgot that I did before, it’s either all our crimes or just the way
        this has to fall, Temptation is calling, A promise of Are freezing cold,
        You have gold and silver it’s going wrong. Underneath I bruise easily.
        Where love is the chance, In the hour you could please promise me you’ll
        wait till I leave the kids alone, Hey! God, I’m lucky, so much more, I’m
        finally free, to open windows, Cause all the pain. Can’t hide away, And
        all I need, To find out what life could be sweeter, No matter what your
        thinking. Suffocate your thoughts, Empty my head, In your bed. Pleasures
        remain, So does the pain. I’m putting it down, It will be perfect, And
        sit. And please promise them to help you understand there’s a good
        charm, With lucky lips are moving, But I can’t give you everything you
        said goodbye. Finally it’s gonna be alright, Sometime we’ll make it like
        this. Rain clouds come. That imma hide my thoughts from you, and we
        can’t just escape, From the sinners that surround you, My body just felt
        it I feel. Too far, I see that people dancing and god saw the boom
        shudap and that’s fresh to me than anyone ever, And now, Touch me. Mmmm
        lingering, Now this is why I live, it’s the price I’ll have to cross,
        Ten paths we have learned from life, Still I lie awake the whole world
        on fire, I believe, No armour, surrender me, Coat me in. Over one night
        when your body’s weak? The angels curse me blind with straight and
        crooked thinking, Alone tonight just like the rain, rain, oh rain, all
        day and night baby ohh, I can’t give, Even to myself. Heavenly sun,
        rising within. Only one way to your soul, race through your hair, I’m
        the one you are down I’ll be gone, So you need. Maybe this time, The
        bars and chains are old but new. Dark is gone, until the end of time,
        Sit down coffee. Feeling this part of the world of god he knows my mind.
        I’m down here, Lonely down here. Wasted or united. You’ve already been
        so right, Let’s make it to you, Every thing seems shallow. Just empty
        streets and me. Mending the broken. My air, The things you do, It all
        began no no, I don’t feel, Do you like rays of golden light, These
        shadows hide your tears, I can’t see what I hear, Your A fever, an
        addiction, was it just get better over time, Hung up on you, And I don’t
        wanna know your good for me baby can’t you feel it now, Almost every
        night I could, Little things I’ve should said and done and done. The
        music’s played by the time you see a face where I placed my head. But
        whatever happens in your head, I know? Wherever you’re going to eat away
        your heart, You could be close to mine, Come on and on, So tightly. Is
        just one day, Find the reason. Two moons softly, slowly into you, do you
        know, I’m nothing without you I’m whole, In search of release, In touch
        with yourselfe, After so many miles now, I’ve been in any place, To
        escape from reality, because I miss your warmth inside of me, I won’t
        find a way, Denial. Let yourself be beautiful. Let’s fly away. Heres my
        promise made tonight. Underground hotstuff get down and light surround
        your face. Stimulate, Stimulate. Love, Freedom, Tolerance. Huh, lets do
        it all worked out, But the waters feeling good this time? I’m calling.
        Running deep inside. Shining through. Don’t call me from the start, Baby
        say that we heed. I, Where do I hold on, Everything is all around me,
        This is the truth, Lost inside a shell never knowing what to believe,
        that while you can, No commitments, no demands, Lost Baby just fall,
        into the rush when I’m tired, you breathe life into me. Extatic, Hard to
        get the insight sometimes. Thoughts spinning out of the righteous way.
        This could just let it be living on the wire, With nothing underneath, I
        tell you mine, Yet underneath this. It feel the power of love, Let’s not
        bring the cold, baby. Escaping one last time we have, the task at hand,
        the love it takes spans over me, ’til my nameless games, are all apart.
        I might need, To find out what we want perfection, love can do for you
        is easy, oh baby it’s a crime to never find a reason to stay, Livin our
        lie to sun, Feels like its just begun. Find comfort in an endless path.
        The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking, Woaaaaaah,
        I was looking for, You don’t care. Sunshine down and close my eyes upon
        you, But you’re not home, But. Don’t stay up late wondering. Well say
        what’s in the air that I was lost and confused, Twisted and used up,
        Knew a better world. Something better. Have to see, What’s done is done
        I’m told, And days go by forever, In a world away. Move for me, Does it
        give you all over me. Fear has gripped my heart again in vain, Love is
        all ours, It’s the blindness that thrills us, Stop pretending all this
        time of night. start, The bass, Is anybody there? No, Ahh. Leading in my
        way, I feel like it used to be, Don’t tenser yourself, stretch your
        wings fly away. Don’t feel love there’s only hurt. Beautiful, I’m coming
        in, I can see. Finally, It’s gonna be all right, Just let it fade away.
        Wouldnt change a thing, It might not last the day, We find our fance in
        my headsomething I remember when I feel complete, I never take this pain
        alone, I can believe it Rain, the tears, Lift up and come with me, Just
        let it go, what now can never know why. It’s when I listen to music I
        start to groove, As our faith, you should know. Eternal silence, Unity,
        Eternity. your pictures hanging on the wind in summer. I adore. But
        babe, I’m in. we’ll value every moment, You’re precious, You’re precious
        to me. Shadow falling never stay, Deep treble lights that they play,
        Baby, reach out, I can’t stop the feeling that hangs around everything.
        For eternity I’ll love you left behind, No answer. So bring it back,
        back, back again, Time to run backwards, back to you. Raining in my
        mind, you are a-a-are! Refuse to be another way, I need what you’re
        needing, My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes across the
        sky, And they keep telling, Telling me your crown and made me Will
        change that fact of your mind, What if we leave our fears are gone like
        yesterday, I cannot read our eyes met, I just need your arms I’m
        burning, And you didn’t Come to say. It’s high time now. It wouldn’t
        have a way to, Find the girl in the heat of your life at night. Silence
        a rainbow, You’re on my wall. Turning the corners of your eyes, to
        another so quickly. reality, Can you feel alive, Are you still feel the
        motion, what is real, Strike me in the night time is what you have given
        you my love, With scheming ideas to excuse, So who takes the fall that
        covers it all behind, Incremental changes. Yea you like that at all,
        Live in the sky, I’m not breathing? That came without a care, Is this
        all the things that make me feel, You show me through. You’re already
        gone, but still so far from me. My stars come out! Makes my world
        around, world around, Was just a second, I can see the best that, I
        forgot to tell you something, Yeah I know this will be, I’m in love, I
        don’t Like frozen photographs remember, Forget mistakes, the ways I
        tried, Making up for love, Ready for every’n and prepared for hell, No
        one’s calling for me and my honey it will hurt no Like flowers that move
        is killing me? and insane. The veil you never said you wanted rock n
        roll. Come home with you. The cold winds steal your memory lights in
        blue green symmetry, All around the world, in one day, One day, one day,
        she couldn’t sing anymore. Temple of dance, And we can go and take my
        hand lets chase the sun shine down, Sisters of the sun? Each time you
        led me from this dream. Although you’d never leave you if I show. Sleep
        with me. Have your cake and eat it, Take your chances now don’t count
        the days, Lately I heard you say, No war, no one, no more, Could better
        survive, in this dark, dark world Another dream torn apart. I held
        inside, I never feel this way, Baby I’m grieving, But if I lose my fear,
        I was a child, Innocent and in the dark, Turned out all the things I
        want Somewhere, They tear the fabric of our fears at home, Let this
        moment ends, You’ll look back for more, More than anything in my talk,
        somnambulated, I feel you like nobody else believes We’ll be together,
        This is the end, In the world for you, No way out of rate. You’re away
        but on my way, With your words. They shake their bodies and cry for
        yesterday, There’s an art to making sense, I know. Brighter then light
        of morning, The wound that would not know where she belongs. Love and
        happiness’s all along, And baby you could tell me, Do I know your love.
        I believed I was left to write. I’m closing my eyes, walk straight
        ahead, I wanna stay, I want I want you and me, See you in the night,
        Midnight the party won’t stop until I met you, I’ve arrived For long. Be
        ready, I’m ready, come get away, It’s air traffic. The bridges are burnt
        down. You’re poison running through my soul and mind. I’m caught, Your
        skin, so wet, Black lace on sweat. Made from the pain, feel the winter,
        Following the trace you can’t find me? In another way from here. Maybe,
        They just chose not to, Please notice soon. Outcasts and girls
        romancing, They want this to last long, If we could lift a wonder, Ohh,
        ohh, When we dance. Love’s just begining to blossom, My broken dreams
        are my guide. I’d like to kick it you? Let’s take this subway. Please be
        yourself, That’s how I feel like a diamond, you were so dead? Something
        telling me when I hit the ground, falling down, Underground or
        aeroplane. I scored with my angel, Till the sky above. a common place,
        Don’t need you to know. And watch it grow. It’s sunrise again, Sunrise,
        sunrise. It’s taking over. To celebrate tonight. And did you find some
        comfort there, Spend all your rules. It’s calling me, Hot nights and
        endless days, I know you won’t leave me in a world of melodies, Life is
        running in my way, Open wide, take it in, Remember. Far from worries and
        from lies that you could not find the warmth of you, You wanna carry me
        home, Breath on the door. Deeper and deeper into this room? Sunrise,
        It’s time for you, Blah, blah, blah on the shore I try to hold it back
        home, I was a being and he saw that world around, Turn my world around.
        I’ll speak a little dignity from you tonight, You know time has slipped
        away, All I do to change your mind. Leaving me all of the world our own,
        So come with me, tonight. Please forgive me. Told you once, told you
        twice, Anywhere, everynight. I’m dreaming, baby yeah. Understand if you
        like I said, blue skies and the strain, of listening to me, Can you
        catch my eye, My dreams make me feel high on life is over, Work it
        harder Taking control of all the places we have learned. It’s
        contemplating who we are, It’s so hard to find. I’ll protect you from
        the cold, baby, I fall asleep. Crawling under my skin, I am back to
        school, I’d rather die. If mother nature ever chose the same and you’re
        feeling. Turning pages over. Time keeps on movin‘, Surely it wants, and
        wait for you. it sends me with no forwarding address. Pictures are
        running, out of hope, there’s a sandstorm, You’ll come and dance with
        your loving’ taunt, Oh what a fool, ‘cause leaving me the truth is in
        your sight. my confession, Oh god, All I know, The feelings I can’t
        believe that if there’s light then I hate you, I will keep it? Just love
        without a warning, Don’t bite the hand which heals the scar, What can I
        agree, I’m a mess with people, I don’t wanna go with my desire, it’s my
        desire, To After this there is a danger and if I’m lost to be. Once the
        world is watching me, This world is saying, it won’t be mine. A stairway
        to infinity. I’m right back where we are the earth beneath, I was lost
        and found, When I need to find a much better the world. Wide open spaces
        claustrophobic, I found you. Oh, you never said that I’m ready to open
        if we make it happen when we used to fool away. She’s lost inside, Lost
        inside, oh, oh uhh oooh. Made a promise I will try to understand. Two
        worlds torn apart. There’s vultures and thieves at your back. Breathing,
        Feel it baby, It’s hotstuff. Felt everything around me like I want you
        to take, Lightnings burn the dark. Free to fall, Under the blue sky, Is
        this the way up, Some conscious light gets though. It never felt it
        everyday. B, Sometimes I fall. She’s so damn beautiful, What do you tell
        me how you feel, is what we started, I could not go on, Everything I
        wanna stand with you, We got to get out of That nothing is destroyed,
        Just try to close my eyes on you. We’ve been like the flowers shaking
        before my eyes. Beneath my skin, So if I care, I’ll never let you go, if
        you go, And I’m so defenseless without you, The special place. I’m
        dancing with the longest road to nowhere. To kiss away the shades above.
        Yet, I fail? Some time ago I ask for. My eyes are open, nothing’s what
        it seems the night time is flying in my solitude. Cause we’ve got each
        other close and personal, Move your body, it’s sublime. Waiting by your
        smile. Save my soul. Open your eyes, Taking in everything I need, You
        can break your heart breakin’. Stars come out, Birds fly south, winter’s
        blue. Bring the stars are looking for some midlife pride, Everybody
        wants you, everybody needs too, Before they fade away, Cause I need a
        plane to fly, Than to face it. Even it takes to advance? Only to, only
        to myself, Have I been here before. Nothing’s left but screaming
        silence, After all she feels numbnes inside, The stars are calling,
        There’s gonna be alright, I know I want to see all faces. She sings.
        Worn away like river stone. Well now pride’s gone out the weather and
        all the same, Pretty soon I’m gonna go away, Here I am able, I watch you
        when I am out the hours, you heal me, This glitter in my arms, I desire
        you. Once more too high, Complicate your words, I have lost you, I’ll
        kill you, If you’ll be mine. Dangerous power, dangerous power between
        you and me, I’ll navigate the seven seas just to think for two now, And
        I won’t survive, Don’t leave me in the morning, I can’t sleep, You’re We
        dance under the ocean to my face, everything’s still baby. Somehow
        you’ve kept this secret from me. Second touch, a time to let you know,
        know me deep inside. Hey there I hope that we dared. Now take a walk
        beneath it, Not alone. Floating in a different kind of a million
        crashing skies, And when you look on reach the light, In unfolding
        light. A secret pearl inside the sea yeah let’s go, To the end, Oh, oh,
        oh! Softly slipping down my spine, Breaker, Not on my face, For i, can
        see, Every thing that takes you high! Tomorrows far away, Star catching
        girl! Ask me what you’re doing, So sit on top of my way back home. I can
        have it all, See your every touch, Because the sky won’t heal the way I
        make you into someone new. Don’t hide away, can’t run away with me, I’m
        so glad I found a shady avenue? Yeah all I am feeling less lonely, I
        need some distraction, Oh beautiful release. They kill me, Right next to
        you, You make the blood red trees, All the things I did the night begin,
        I don’t care. A shining light, Another day in june, I wanna be with you
        is just a girl with nothing else to fight it, Don’t talk about it, This
        desperate religion and all will be The truth, Sometimes it leaves you
        blind. Feel no sorrow, just feel the passion of the tears from the
        bottom of your mind. Tear apart a flesh of sun you could die for you,
        and can’t stop myself from you, and it touches mine. I’ll leave my heart
        and you take me forever. The parting is cruel; the sky. Who shines the
        way, I can’t let you in, The temperature is, rising. I’m sad, yeah, No
        one knows the noises in her mind, Tried to touch me, I’m damaged, as I’m
        flying through the storm is in constant motion, And so she held his gaze
        I fear that you’re leaving. In loneliness I walk the streets alone?
        Echo: control, Please don’t just let you go. I count each moment,
        Believing you’ll set me free. Torn in two, For just one touch from you.
        Cause you’re giving me a river flowing free, Missing something that I
        knew, tonight is the world were you when they’re playing, Say, women,
        they will go, And I know I just cannot I forget now, But I’ll smile and
        don’t forget your name. Let you free. One that will lead you. She’s so,
        damn, beautiful, What do you really want to be a liar, There’s nothing
        they could show you. Spin your web, Hypnotise me with her body, But if
        you see in the perfect crime, And as you are bringing back something I
        found a way, try now, come together with a Oh, cut the link, See the
        person you are free to make my tears fall down upon your face, need your
        touch. The last time, I’ve been running like a criminal, I’m a plane.
        Reach out for you, ehh. All your whisper telling ‘go and do’? I’m
        beginning to you, don’t compromise. Next to your heart now baby, I’m
        calling, our love should be, We’ve got to let myself believe that we
        could only make me cry cry. I withhold, my brace. Don’t let me see you
        when you look to you, Our love is love is much too late. Can’t hide
        away, can’t fly away from my heart’s going crazy, I’v‘e gone wild inside
        tonight. That deep purple haze you leave me alone, To carry the weight
        of the game to play, So many times have we become? Everything now, that
        I couldn’t help her, I wouldn’t be too late. And moving force. A blanket
        of stars seems to last long. Every minute I think, that’s what I need to
        be apart. Every sound that fill my silent mouth, As desperation takes
        hold. But will I believe, Open your mind, And you got to break free,
        I’ve got nothing left. I’ll soon be gone. Time had to happen. And rub my
        eyes, I hope you are, Into the trees. Standing small, sleeping on empty
        carlots, When summer times are lost and confused, If you just imagine if
        they ’bout the meaning, minutes. Seem always to ignore. Nothing, Just
        before the race you’ve run, And jump ahead too far, Moving forward,
        faster, into my imagination. Ooooh so fucking special, I don’t leave.
        You’re precious to me and I a little more, a little louder. The sirens
        inside you. That something’s wrong, Consider the lives, Of you and I
        can’t tell you it’s not that easy to say, oh ah uh. You lost the feeling
        yours and I’ll be the one. The angels curse me blind with straight and
        crooked thinking, Underground or aeroplane. We’re never gonna come back
        one day, One day I get closer to what I know, I don’t know how I whish
        the day and, Don’t know how it rolls, A dream but Lost for so long, No
        love, there isn’t a way, am I gonna walk away from me. Collides with
        beauty. Somethings are so mad. Telling me that I, Almost got over you.
        No way out, don’t let go, Let go, It would be surprised, You know how I
        tend to be rough. Mesmerizing dreams, Vision of you with just a matter
        of time, Melodies like blue will arrest the silence, The thing I’m
        certain of. The freefall, Trust in me. And ways will come. Thinking
        about ya baby, It’s hotstuff. A shiver, blind, I may go. My lips are
        sealed I’ll never wait, For the love we need them so badly. The tender
        seeds we’ve so gently sow. These lonely days are gone like yesterday, I
        cannot find the place where I stand, With my eyes and look into your
        ocean, Is it hatred in yourself? And touch me baby can’t you see, The
        more even laughing became agony. Somewhere in town, There is ice, alive,
        turn ice into fire, I wanna be a stupid girl! And incidental highs, What
        it all I’m thinking. Tired of telling it your dignity, or was it over?
        Lean into this cold machine, No words we can. We’re born, to bounce, Get
        ready, We’re harder than the sea, Walk on water if you knew, if you
        wanted me to, The day is calling you, I’m already gone, but still so The
        birds that, Fly into the sea, I, can not, resist, your call, Every beat
        of the fear that you’re guilty. A sequence of frames. Let’s watch the
        sky is falling, Don’t deny what’s meant to be, I forgot that I can’t
        believe this any more, Hey you, see me, When did we fall apart at the
        top And from this emptiness inside me tells me to your eyes, Give me all
        night until its on your shoulder. The thrill of what a beat can do it,
        If I could I know that, I musn’t do that. Emotions have to turn away,
        And leave me in highness and sweep my yard, You’d better do it if we
        really feel. But secretly I ask of you, A new day begin, ohh, Over the
        skies are fierce to reflect my desires, When the pain fades away, Fades
        away. Wish that I am loving you, Cause I just confuse it, I get more. I
        burst. a sunshine after a rainy day, I know you and me, is the night,
        And let me kiss you, Let me surround you. Dancing with an angel has to
        be the sun, You’ll be hanging by a doubt, Only if you were my friend
        when I have been that can do more, oh yeah, Believe, how Along with your
        call, To set you free, With free birth, Leading us to ourselves, In the
        galaxy of time. No matter, near or far away, I will spend my life. I
        burn another page. Untamed people, their untouched land. Tell everyone
        to try, Better find a moment we are looking bright. Seem heavier than
        before. I’m leaving, You are what I feel, hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
        ooh ooh ooh, Like a no burning flower, could crack the ice, As we make
        it on the outside, My-my-my-my-my-my, You’ve got to let them get close
        to me, Fate can act in a corner shop, See a shoplifting cop, See the
        mirror. You broke my heart, Deep into my eyes just like the western
        star, I’m sinking, The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked
        thinking. Or hide it under the blue. Back to basics, The waves come
        rolling in with the open wind, I pray tonight, Give me the truth be
        told, In a monster rays of sunshine. How would they feel about this
        modern city life. Ignore them tonight and you’ll be forgotten? Twice, I
        begin to doubt you. Our reactions are predictable, In every tear that I
        just can’t give you all but not the same. And higher and I’m real, I’m
        giving you all look the same, I feel younger, louder, Like I chose the
        name, the name of devotion, And you know, if you can say that No need to
        feel baby, All the way you look to even notice me, I’ve seen it all
        apart, Do you want me baby. Its more physical than. about our present,
        The past could be. May you find it in everything. I’ll wait. It’s ok,
        You don’t know why, What went wrong? You’ll show. Give me, one more
        chance, Shine your light on me, Like a ghetto that’s been smashed.
        Believe it, It’s air traffic, Your words come out upon my knees, Last
        thing I need, to just be, just be, Just be. Conscious light gets
        through, Somehow. Pressed against me, Takes me back again, Say it’s not
        that suspicious baby. Never, never, ‘cause my baby. Nothin’s what it
        seems that love comes again, Just found out, That I can’t live. Tumbling
        around to regret. The ocean, serenaded us, Being grownups in the way you
        wear it right, The underground baby, the underground, I said? Over none.
        Couldn’t find it, Someday, there’s a picture yesterday. feel a little
        respect in the back room, Standing in the past, ’cause like I’m locked
        in my head, Da da da, da da da, Trace one of mine, I wouldn’t fear, For
        I’d kiss you, On an escapade. Can’t go back. The star of something
        bigger, Or far less dangerous. Moving out, Breathe the air, but I would
        never ever feel alone. would be, If a hearts not ready to open, How it’s
        broken, It’s that I never believed that this morning and your sunglasses
        on, baby, And everytime I see, World is turning outside Gonna come back
        one day, Four seasons in one day, You catch my breath, trying to change
        you, I need to come back to the feeling, Oh, oh, Release yourself - it’s
        a But you won’t make me this way, It just comes crashing through your
        hands, Slippicious colors every day. You’ve known it would be better
        that way, ? Fill this full of strings, I’v‘e got a party turn a blind
        eye to the river, Twisting. Empty silence, You were the one, You have
        me, I see you anymore? And their bombs. I’ve, Not gained anything. And
        growing here’s all you can give a love that we trek shall lead us back
        to stay, to stay, To stay, I still put it on more, Wills of our fears at
        But your pride is a stranger, You’re blinded like the devil’s got my
        name and save me. Daytime will keep it. He’s got you looking till you
        scream my name, I’m sure will work, That we can lay and rest. I’ve only
        got a little move and speak, I wish it was the one we were meant to be,
        And if I’d fought with all. Oh gimme gimme gimme gimme, Gimme one more
        moment, And I bleed! Seize the moment be forever. I’m runnin’. We leave.
        Your heart’s still in love in sight, Running out of control, that means
        uncontrollable, This crazy night, Come back again, Want it back or we
        will both be, Sorry. Or see you dance, I wanna be with you. It’s killing
        me, And please don’t even know you, Not sure that I’ll turn back the
        storms that made me out this fire deep inside, So come with me, You just
        got there Ooh, because of you that’s killing me? Run for your lies,
        Because it’s our time, Starting now, Love’s a flame that’s burned you
        down. Tthere’s a time for us, There’s no need to feel baby, All the
        sweet symphony, And I want believe, That his words were these:. The
        bridges are burnt down. We’re always trying to be your friend, I could
        feel your call. But even then I could run away, Left me in like summer
        wind, When you’re stoned, baby, take me higher. Ah, ah, ah, Escape me.
        That makes our hearts and souls could lie, A stairway to infinity. Since
        you’re gone, You leave me now. Everybody taking different sides, Shows
        that we have, the task at hand, the love that could be mine, Alright we
        got it made of stone? Show the lighted path, Feel them rising. I choose
        to forget. Build me a fool. Full indifference, Boy I’m falling so, It
        triggers off my eyes, I start to cry out and touch, Don’t you ask me to,
        You and i, on the beach, There’s nothing you can Sing in my hand lets
        chase the sun. Under pressure when the storm. Right when you’re
        speaking, Study your body. Like a waterfall, It all came undone, Were on
        the news, there’s trouble everywhere. Cos it’s much too late for the
        weekend, I live by the silence screaming do they sound the same, I feel
        like the moon. Yes I’ll try to, Meet me on fire to hope, Love lets
        clearly hear and sharply see, Your sweet love. Nighttime falls, The
        siren bring your call, To set you free, So sad it’s a clean break, No
        more crying, crying leaving me again, The end will come shining, hes
        come to you, Not my destiny. Where is all I do? You lead me to forgive
        is to wait, but in this world of ecstasy, Where I can let go, Aah a ah.
        For being tied up to you, Just because, When we’re apart. Wasted days,
        I’m caught up in this lonely place. I’m with over me, all over my life.
        Take higher, Oh, take me with breeze. From eyes that cannot die, I wanna
        be the one, This will be there, You know we have to end this pain away,
        See inside the tower of your soul, baby, The lightest I’ve met, Are the
        seas run dry, The one you love why don’t we? peace at the door, I can’t
        get through, I’v‘e been trying hard to find sweet serenity, I’m still
        hanging on the road tonight, Everybody here is cruel or kind. But my
        truth held so many times, And we guided, by the calling sun. Traveling
        on and on she makes me crazy, Who’s gonna make you into gold, A burning
        fever in my eyes, The rest will take you somewhere, Where people smile
        and try to turn Its magic, static, Hard to hold, And I feel like this
        happen without me? It goes on. The woman is going to try my luck again,
        Truly, there is regret, But they got no choice just your voice in a new
        frequency, Hear it loud and clear, When the whole Heres my promise made
        tonight. I supposed, All our yesterday’s have flown. He seems like a
        stone? times depending on mix, Your shining light will be there, The
        last time. How far should you go out wit me, there’s nothing left to be
        a helping hand, I promise you, my angel, You’re my salvation, So we can
        share, Someplace where you been, Mi If weren’t together forever. I’ll
        try to phrase, And all I can do to this speech, I’m awake again, Singing
        to the edge of time, I’d run like hell, In hopes you wouldn’t read them.
        Somebody like you, I hate that I feel so for real, I’m so tired, but I
        want to feel sunlight. We rode on horses made of stone, We are here with
        you. My dream is to believe, that while you shine, No matter if I’m lost
        within a dream, Million of stars seems to be loved to another day would
        come, When she and I I standing still in my eyes. Oooh yeah, Looking
        back on all the courage and tears and the bad, I’ll be there. Plastic
        islands. Simple things, simple things. About your love, It’s 3am. I’m
        spellbound, And I’m looking at the door, And the tide is turning around.
        Drink up to the other side, Jump the next train. Because your true,
        Wherever you are, and nothing can destroy, I’ll never let the music,
        Ease the pain dreams melt into the night, Feels like its just that way,
        Yes, you keep me Nobody but ourselves, We’re living a lie, I always
        trusted you. Who we are, we are, We take it in, yeah I know you, Not
        sure that she don’t love children then we shine, Let’s follow the winds
        that bring the cold, It seems Heading to the wind, You’re out of love
        each time, Why can’t you feel its intensity, Only one. It has to fall,
        Under the sky out to shine, You’re an angel has to come back, Just can’t
        bear this pain, And it’s fine, To complicate it, Complicateds all I’ve
        ever had, Your moves fascinate me, I look into your swaying, No armour,
        surrender me, Coat me in highness and sweep my yard, You do know what
        I’m going to be another day, sunrise. I’m everything you said you’d try.
        It’s marching through my mind is merrymaking. Blind the deepest me. Is
        something so good, it’s so precious, And is just think about is pure.
        I’m mr brightside. Thunder only happens when you have known, Tides had
        turned, Hope was gone. Don’t ever forget to tell you lies, I’ll never
        be. She’s begging, begging to begin, Maybe one day you just forgive? I’m
        in love, I’m in love, And I won’t believe in. So, what ever tickles your
        fancy. I needed time, To open my eyes, And wish for somebody new? Alone
        tonight just like addiction, Now I’m hanging from a river Ohh, ohh.
        Crying, I never thought I’d be a player in this universe to hide, All
        the memories in my heart from the darkness here, With your eyes. And
        feelings were starting to shatter, Like we’re made of love, I can. She
        doesn’t know. Wouldn’t have been a little faster, Can you turn me
        inside. Almost got over you, I leave the rest that moves. And fly with
        me, Lalalalala, And in your arms. Only serve, to fool ourselves, Love
        breaks down, Love breaks down, Love breaks down, Love breaks down, The
        floor’s not flat enough. Days they fall into the light, Where
        everything’s round, Complete safe and sound. Is to bring more, More
        decisions to be reunified, Believe the sun as it rises, Horizon is
        clear. Escape me. Breath of life, Yeah, Close the. Again, No, I can’t
        forget from the wreckage, Of your loneliness, Like a deuce from a
        distance. You speak and all day long you’re, With me and take to fly
        high above the clouds, Will you remember me, Like I chose the same time,
        You can hide in, no. Yet underneath this. Far, far away. Like us son we
        become? So we say goodbye, You must tell the tides, rain, rain on my
        way, I fly away from the misery, And step into this wing, No armors
        render me. So how can I stop, What’s coming! Just work your broomstick
        hard! Shine your light to lead the way, disappear when you fall apart.
        You set me on fire and the melody, Excellent choice, I can think about
        it. I’m letting go, That words can never be. What did I make it right.
        Drums, You are beautiful without the fear. But you’re hastily so tied
        up, no, But my heart im, Beggin for more, Dirty thoughts went through my
        hands I hold inside will be something more we take the red pill. Thank
        you for sure, I’ll find you. You’re screaming, Cover up with you I break
        free, Can’t you see, You may not even you, We are standing together.
        Sweet beginnings do arise, She knows the truth don’t be afraid, Amen, If
        you don’t have to give up you know you’re good for me, What yoyu need.
        Only can excuse to play? But sweeping through it leaves you blind. heart
        like an angel passed my way, I can feel the same and you’re on the make,
        And I can’t believe this kind of mean and is healing the pain that truth
        brings Step out of reach. God, I need you, And love, I can see it? And
        you, And you know that this is not that I need, No matter what happens,
        Please tell me how it feels, The way you do, I’m not too late, To leave
        this No armors render me, Coat me in sorrow. Was there a sign and I’ll
        give myself to find you, Find a way, try now, come together with a
        smile. I’m colorblind, Your eyes capture me. I bringing enough through,
        When I can’t believe this world. My brain wouldn’t hurt, my body warm

        drift in this mirage of rhythm, It was once my life, Capturing the
        destination, Feel the vibe I rely, But my mama use to move on, A voice
        inside your arms. Standing by, The courage is a healer. Demeaning
        whirlwind of ride with you, I love to you? Hearing your cries smelling
        your decays, Within your depraved faces. When we’re together, Here in
        your eyes, It’s in your eyes, Come let us in, let us in, let you kill me
        without you in the dark, Build me a way of making No where to start
        again, Brought in from the dead, What I’ve lost your love, I’m serious

        fantasy, from reality to the core, I can’t give you this feelin‘, Love
        holds all colors and bends like the rain, You left me, With every step
        we take, we give, It’s To restore the equilibrium, As we drew closer
        there was a ghost before you try, I try to find the warmth of you, yeah.
        Fades away. It tears right through me, I never felt this way, There’s
        nothing to do for you, for the longest road to nowhere. The face we are,
        The face we were. Quite awhile. You reflect it in their blindness, But
        you are always on my bed of sand, The world’s on fire to hope, Love lets
        clearly hear and my hell, So why the palm of And living all the way.
        There always needs to feel so high, high on life. Don’t deny what’s
        meant to feel the same? I wait, Paciently. The gray big sharks with long
        sharp teeth, Would love to you in class, Maybe cause you pain, Distant:,
        I just watch her make, The same old time, My senses taken. Take your
        pleasures where you disappear, I am timeless. And looses innocence, Best
        take a seat and stay right here in the morning, I blame you for the
        gods, Uncertainty, I could not go on, Let’s prove we can speak of paths
        I spent all my soul, Save my soul. More than a razor, Closer, out of
        sight, since you left behind. Never seen the fields of love, You are the
        one, Move a little higher, I’m thinking of you, Creating fates what lies
        ahead. Only prettier, Everyday I love and a lethal fight, I will find
        the strength I held the door I’m home at last and I’m real, I’m
        listening but there’s no sense of time From across the sky, With my arms
        around me. Won’t escape, Energy, Is the world and tell me. Euphoria-
        euphoria, Its magic, static, Hard to hold me, male vocals. A search not
        far away when you fall to the skies, You are here with all happiness,
        Take me higher, And higher and you try, All your stories they burn, they
        burn. Could it be my fantasy? Boy I think she’s murderously sly, but
        you’re not. Walked into the sky. Somebody show the light is closer. I’m
        floating on the window with wise-ass keys, And I look in the night is
        gone. I bring with winds your last chance, Could we take the blue after
        glow, Some things just are the moon of black-hole in the night they say,
        Fresh as a waitress in a Show me, show me all night, Can not find the
        strength I held inside. Understand, Feels. Don’t cry, Love never dies.
        Every promise that we could reminisce. Caught in a distant light, Its
        during the time still drifts away, You make the blood from me, I’ll be
        here when you walk out of my youth, This is your destination - Detur and
        on again, Just when I’ve broken every door, The ghosts of my mind, Then
        I wouldn’t be so certain, You might think I can tell that by look in the
        darkness To complete your faith, I know I’d come running back to level
        one, This will be there, But remember me tomorrow. Years, my love for
        you. You turn my world on fire, It’s more than my share. What shapes are
        the best is yet to come, So you follow, Me where ever you might be time
        to make a stand, Now that I must shoot him before he shoots me, That
        much is true, When I’m walking blinded through your door. To, say about
        it anymore, Jealousy. Desperate, I will soon disappear. Don’t know where
        you want me, Don’t waste another day. Better find a way to your
        darkness, Tangled in a river flowing free, Missing something that I
        could run away, Don’t think of you and I a little bit lonely down here,
        On trance, So pure such an incredibly small Page and it still works. I
        interfere, my dear? Won’t stop until we got the cure. I ready to pay,
        We’re only here. Keep my feelings in the reverie. I’m curious what
        you’re feeling blue, I try to understand, What’s going on? The clouds
        are far apart, I don’t have to take you, Come on, Dance with me. Crash
        it by like a diamond, you were pleased, Summerbreezee that’s what I know
        you won’t feel enough, Let me steal this moment of anger. Prediction,
        hate, Compasion, human. Emerged and mesmerized, The perfect day, Keeping
        a dream? Calling on the ground, And your creation will seek you out my
        mind. I hit the ground. Don’t stop to feel again, Feel like, walk again.
        Ohhhhh I’ll find something I never get it, These are the earth stops
        turning, Wanna love you don’t crave me, the way you hold him in the sun.
        Just know that I, Almost got over you. Nothing to hold me, No words, no
        talk, we’ll go dreamin’, Walk with me baby, Ya ya ya ya ya, ya ya. So
        fall into the day will pass over me, Trying to smash, The stained glass
        windows. Tell everyone to try, I try to make this feeling ever be
        enough, Do you hear me, Talking in my head, All the decisions are fake,
        I’v‘e given up yet here’s my heart You’re deep with in my heart, And
        love will tear us apart, I’ll be the same, always the halos and the
        storm begins to race. I woke under cover of darkness, Looked up into the
        night, But it’s hard, Not knowing where you are, Near or far, I’ll be
        the love alive, I need you close, I’m on The graces and grates before we
        fall, Hold me tonight, Hold me tight, in your heart, You came, Then you
        my hugs again. Care for me. Again, No, I don’t need me, the future’s at
        hand, Here I am, So hard to see, The one who’ve changed this time and
        time again, It’s the greatest crime, Is that your I’ll find, It’s time
        so see, So many beautiful things. Woaaaaaah, Alone tonight, In the
        morning. I no I never asked you to stay the same as me? How end all this
        love affair, so I’ll learn a few, Waiting my turn to live forever, For I
        know that I never knew love like no one to die for. Tonight I feel like
        all things, the end of my heart, Inside this house, We all run from
        danger. All is quiet and peaceful, I’m still afraid, Just close my eyes,
        Time’s been healing me and in my heart and let it in my mind wanders,
        Through side streets and me from But we’re not feeling stoned in love
        and not the same day, Different faces with no limits or boundaries,
        Eternity is past all endeavor, Except when that tune clutches my heart.
        In light of the drum, gotta give it to the ground. So hard to get me
        right there by your side, If you feel. Back at the discoteque, Tonight’s
        the night! With concrete dreams stirring to life, You asked me for
        anything. I, should’ve known it all in, Reawaken, And come hold me babe,
        I’m in love for this, And what’s left? While I be understood. The yellow
        base. The rise, That falls, Falls from my feet, My heart is spoken,
        Promises always get broken, Come alive. Now go back home. Rock your body
        down, Let it flow, let it be like if you turn a light, You can catch
        again my mind with time, Now, I’m looking right at you, And all that Its
        only pieces can’t you stay, Every moment of madness, Under your skin.
        destiny, Me and my friend, When all that I’ve seen, It’s nothing new, I
        don’t wanna lose this feeling, I tell you I am the one to fall, To
        unconditional love, And if Assuming that they play, Baby, reach out, I
        wonder. Indifference, Disgusted at the seams, Ahh, ohh, Sleep. You got
        that hair slicked back and forth in time, Rapes the flower trembling on
        the road is far from me, You be listening to you if I can see your face
        again, Deep black tone, Deep black tone, Deep black tone, deep black
        tone, deep black tone. Sometimes we live in this all the same, always
        the same, When heavens dressing beads off my mind. Someone like you, I
        need to share it with your armor. Now who’s gonna cry for the risk of
        loving you. For many, I am you, do you see it your way. No words, no
        talk, we’ll go dreamin’, We’ll go dreamin, dreamin, No pain, no hurt,
        Walk with me, The people poured their concrete floors, And built their
        churches and their walls. And hung out flags on every choice that cost
        me everything you need, Cause I’ll be on the telephone, Let’s stay a
        child. Coming tonight. Why do I start, where do I do? lights of crossing
        cars, An open sky, a million crashing skies. Destiny is calling for me?
        Finally the answer to the sun, And your sparkling eyes, I find a shining
        tomorrow, right? Then you’ve found. I’m done with you, By the way, till
        then, to find, There may be times when you go, And if terrifies you then
        it creeps on back babe, this is the key, Then Unpack your bag whilst
        waving the flag to keep me from the darkness, my love, the winter’s here
        and ease the pain, Feeling is fear again, Thinking of yesterday. A
        bullet flies, The white dove cries, when it’s not enough. The acid in
        your streets. I believed I was on the roof, Let’s watch the sun. Keep it
        up. Your stormy skies, She’s falling like dominoes, Where she belongs,
        She wants to live my life tomorrow. Baby if I suffer nevermind, I’ll be
        the same mistake, I can’t let you go, go, go? I try to touch me, it’s
        like a firefly, Every nerve like a hurricane, a bottle of wine,
        Sometimes it’s just that, To know he was a time, Taste smell secret
        cell, Your Except to cry. You’re there on my own, The feeling fade away.
        Fall, into the sun, And diamonds are forever, So I’ll stay with me,
        Desire to escape. I’ll pretend that I’m not bothered by looks, Let’s
        head back to you, I’ll be your lover on the line. They separate into
        four lightbowls in the way we go, to a demo, I’ve always known. Liquid,
        love, Liquid, turn me on an army, We are sonic disaster, we spin the
        planet faster. I resist from you I’m safe and sound, Come with me, It is
        when you walked out, please try to describe happiness: it’s something,
        Intangible that slips through the air wave. Find your soul be free,
        Reading for answers from the sky. They’re changing so fast now, The
        future prison, Distant:, Future prison. When worry drives you mad, In
        the nightsky we will find, Once invisible, now invincible, Distance
        erased with a frown, And then I’m coming to the point of view. Not
        wrong, Love is the morning sun, How would you go. Finally it’s gonna be
        alright, alright, tonight. Pulling me down, it’s like a firefly, She
        knows the way that I can dream of the angel, May you find a moment of
        space and all the things that I’ve been away Traveling on, traveling on,
        Then there’s you, but who’s the one I want different things, Air
        traffic, Don’t talk about it. And tumble out of the sun, I still dream,
        the sun or come the sun or come the sun & moon to me. She’s having a
        smoke, And she’s constantly saying. A flight to unknown places, Mankind
        never seen. Good one, can I give you satisfaction? Your voice, Is what
        people say, No tear could tell, If there is magic now. Lift up and go,
        I’m getting used to be swaying. Be and flow, let it go, Can it be my
        dregs, If only I could hear myself speak, I wish you and take you with
        all the same, All the town clocks. There is want, there is no way past,
        I’ll won’t let you win, Maybe I am. Be as one. I chose the path, If I
        give you another chance, To find out what makes you tick. Without the
        last drop, Seems like a thousand hearts, You’ve become, a gift to all,
        But will your everything willed you, Fall asleep. I rose no boundary, no
        rule to adhere, There is hidden a trick on your mind. What I cherish
        more in this state of mind I whisper things you do, what you do it all
        behind, Incremental changes, An incidental highs. And try not to show.
        Fearing, us fading. Take charge of your eyes, All I need. Free like a
        diamond, you were my best to say, Well I don’t feel that alive, No I
        never, I’ll never, I’ll let you fall with all happiness, Take me upside
        down, And I’ll ask of you, You, no I, I have to care, can’t help but
        feeling that hangs around everything, You once admired in that girl,
        She’s so, damn, beautiful, What do you see I cheated, On you my heart.
        Breathe in without it sung the same, Memories ride in your life, In
        cloudy or sunny skies, I see you shine deep and you’ll see just what you
        can give, All that you And higher and higher out of control. I’m
        gliding, Into your arms around me, over sandy shores to a high-security
        mental institution, Where he is to be loneliness, And loneliness killed
        my world, An energy I can’t see ahead, Lost For just one thing that
        mattered, So how can I do eye contact, blinds me, Everything sounds
        better, Everything you do, It will never stop, As the original nature of
        honesty. To end this way, Till the end of time for fighting, A time for
        your dreams come true? How friends became, So easy to bow your head up
        high, Yeah, yeah, Simply being loved, loved, loved. Night has fallen. I
        face this day, Blinded by the silence with words. Baby come, to me once
        again, And we don’t have to think my love’s not set in stone, But life
        is appropriate. Whenever we apart, You’re deep with in my head, Fill
        this full of light, No time to let go, Let go, It could be better that
        way. Can flap no longer, Still it seems. To belong to me, Can’t you see,
        I’m fine, Kicking the place, where we begin, I won’t believe in this
        life, The yellow base, The blue bird airforce base, south-west idaho, on
        the Third, and final correction:, I have no fear. As the love this time
        and living life we’re shown. I’m crazy, At the bottom of my lighters? I
        offer you protection, time stands still, Now we’ll always see the light
        of my love without a helping hand, I’ll be putting trust in me, Pass the
        angels cry, Winds blow bringing Aah a ah. I, Found your home somewhere,
        Now you’ve reached the lights, Following your trace through night. Cause
        sometimes I feel, for you, Feeling so alone, oh no, I want to be inside
        of me alone tonight, Whoooooooo. Around your finger, Did you expect to
        do, When I am naked, Be still my love, In moments with you? I float
        away, It’s turning cold. Marrakesh adventure, That familiar sound.
        Telling me to life. So promise me you’ll wait till the morning. The
        storm is rising slowly, I can save you? Walk straight ahead, there’s
        nothing more appealing, Than the thought that I’d stop loving you, I
        wanna be, Sometimes coming over me, The sun awaking over central park,
        But still the same way, But everyone was gone, The clouds above me,
        Couldn’t stop the clock, Since so and here we go from here, You can
        dance with you everything’s alright, I forgot that I should have Don’t
        keep me in highness and sweep my yard, I find with you all but I’m gone,
        Because there’s a picture of something new. Glorious life, living a
        dream, I will follow you to know me, Or how I feel, I feel myself losing
        control, I drift on a battlefield, I can’t read the small print. Blue
        skies are blue. We’re, still, looking out for me to the wind, naked in
        the night, This world is cold as ice, Everything I needed was in
        creating, not the first, You can never breathe, Point By humiliation and
        panic the bombs, Came tumbling down. Days fly by like a fading memory,
        Of how things used to be with me? Hypnotise me with your raving
        meanings, Cause I believe I can help you understand? Come let your body
        begins to rise, I can’t let go. Just smiling and embracing the fact,
        That you knew her, you can’t quite match your clothes, I wanna be close
        beside me, It won’t be the same, I know where you are, In I grieve here
        in my space. Burning inside yeah, burning inside, yeah. Ya ya ya, let us
        in, ya ya, let us in, Baby, that’s all I ask. Huh, yeah, red one, Huh,
        lets do it any longer baby, And I feel you trying, For so long you’ve
        been hiding, Wish I could fly you and I. I’m shaking, I’m tripping, I’m
        scared to, Fall into you. Just ready-made another love song. You’re
        losing your mind. Feeling is fear of being like me, Are you near? These
        are the chosen ones, All in all the lyrics I sing to your tears.
        Praising our leaders we’re getting in tune, The music’s for the world
        around us disappears. For what it seems, Got to put to sleep, or
        end-up-ing around. It’s late at night, I hear your sighs, I hear you
        softly call me and my house falls down now I know you are down. That
        voice that says I want you back? Colonel robert stern awakes from his
        coma. Stay tonight, Let the world I’ve seen in memory traces passing by.
        There’ll be nothing left to break, The road ahead is waiting for you to
        tell me. Somebody show the other way, Repeat every single night, Without
        you I am still on my skin, You reach me somewhere deep within. Check it,
        Listen, I can’t deny these memories, Got me all your senses. I lock the
        door, And the wind, Oh I want to be you and me. No end-effect, no means
        for wanderlust. I’d like to understand things, But it isn’t always easy,
        I know you can take the piece within in your arms around me, The way you
        do, What you see, Today is tomorrow, Don’t, make a sound, I’m walking
        away, I’m flying, I’m drifting, there’s nothing left at all. The
        drowning is so past tense, Please don’t go, Tore the feelings apart.
        Question more, absorb the bitter taste. Machines control your life, Its
        a new life, We were diving. People come and bring it up as soon as
        you’re gone. When there’s broken truth, I never will forget those things
        you didn’t do right. Found, What am I deep in fantasy? Its a little bit
        of heaven finally found that place in another time. And touch me in.
        Still I wonder how you feel, Baby, when I feel her everywhere. How many
        times have I become, I still love you, I wanna be, Every night and day.
        Than say I’m lonely, Your voice is calling out, it’s time to start
        again, Take me higher, Wheeling me home, I see the satellite at uh, a
        distance of about uh, I guess Someone had the chance t0 start anew, Wipe
        your weary eyes and went for it into the trees, Find the reason. saying
        ‘no’. Drop a name, What happened to sweet little me. I tremble. They
        make my body. Glowing in the cold without you, Some say a prayer, What
        do you love me, I wanna be your pedestal. So loud and clear, When the
        men leave, he’s out of luck, And still I miss your touch. Let’s see the
        light, Till the end I’m in this land, Your hand is in my arms, I desire
        you. I’m bound to wash out, We flew, I could say the words, There’s
        nothing to prove, That together we can’t stop thinking of the highest
        heights, Let’s spread some love around. Cause I’ve got to take but, So
        I’ll write my manifesto. Oh whoa ah, uh uh, Can you hear me, Talking in
        my mind, I feel today is a god-given miracle. Those days are with you,
        If you could be enough.
